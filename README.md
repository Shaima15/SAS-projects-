**1- Airbnb prediction using machine learning**

This project aimed at predicting the price of Airbnb listings using various categorical and numeric variables. Three different models were used namely linear regression 
with lasso selection, decision tree and random forest. Finally, these models were evaluated and compared to select the best model  by comparing RMSE across training and
test datasets. 

In this project, I handled extreme values, performed log-transformation to make the data have a normal distribution, created various visualizations, assessed and handled 
multicollinearity, and performed feature engineering and categorization to reduce dimensionality, enhancing model efficiency and predictive accuracy.
